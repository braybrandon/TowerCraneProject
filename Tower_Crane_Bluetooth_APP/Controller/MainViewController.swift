//  Purpose: The main View controller that is the initial view the user sees. Has 3 Buttons Simulator button, Manual control button, and connect Bluetooth button. When the simulator button is pressed the Simulator View is shown and the automation for the tower crane is ran. When the manual control button is pressed the manual control view is presented to the user allowing them to control the tower crane manually. Bluetooth connection button that allows the user to connect to the tower crane
